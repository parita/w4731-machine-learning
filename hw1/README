Problem 1:
=========
Error rates in % have been plotted against the size of the training data sample 
used after random selection. The plot is in the file 'hw1_p1.jpg'

Problem 2:
=========
1. Description:
   For prototype selection, it would beneficial to combine similar datapoints 
   and have a representative of each of these combination in the smaller
   training data. To do this, we can use techniques like K-means or meanshift to
   find the representative points. While meanshift is more reliable, it is more
   complex and can select arbitrary number of data points. For this problem, I 
   have used K-Means to find 1000 clusters from the set of 60,000 data points 
   where the centroid becomes the representative data points of each cluster.
   The label for this centroid is assigned as the label which gets majority 
   votes in the cluster.
   The K-means function for MATLAB is included in the zip, and it is the
   implementation by Tim Benham for Fast K-means algorithm.

2. Pseudocode:
   - For the given set of data, divide the data into 10 sets, each for a label
     (digits 0-9 in this example).
   - For each set of data points, run K-means[1] clustering algorithm to find the
     cluster center.
   - For each cluster, find the mode of the labels of the data points in the 
     cluster. 
   - Assign this mode to the respective cluster center.
   - The cluster center with their newly assigned label becomes the prototype 
     selected set.

3. Test error rates:
   --------------------------------------------------------
   |         m        |  1000  |  2000  |  4000  |  8000  |
   |------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
   | Error rates in % | 4.0800 | 3.9500 | 3.2900 | 2.8900 |
   --------------------------------------------------------
