2. Term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) weighting: 12.4535 %
3. Bigram Representation:
4. Fourth Representation:
  (i)	tf-idf = tf(w, d) x (ln(idf(w, D)) + 1): 12.5215 % 
	for stop_words only specified by sklearn
  (ii)  tf-tdf = tf(w, d) x (ln(idf(w, D)) + 1): 11.5385 %
	for all words except one letter words	
5. Naive Bayes: 18.1125 %
